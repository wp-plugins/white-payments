White makes accepting online payments in the Middle East ridiculously easy. No payment gateway, no merchant account. Get started in under 5 minutes.

== Description ==

White is a full-stack payments solution, that allows you to process online payments on your website or mobile app. 

> If you're using Wordpress & WooCommerce, then you're in for a special treat!

We've developed this WooCommerce plugin to make integrating your store with White a walk in the park! In the same time it would take you to make a cup of coffee, you could be up and running with online payments in the Middle East! 

That's right. Doesn't matter if you're in Bahrain or the UAE, it'll work fine either way.

== Requirements ==

In order to start using White, please head over to [http://whitepayments.com/](our website) and register for an online account (it'll only take a few minutes; we'll wait..)

Got the account? Great .. now make sure to get the following details as well: `Live secret key`, `Test secret key` and the `Public Encryption key`. This will be needed when setting up the WooCommerce payment plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the `white-woo.zip` file to your `wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the options in the WooCommerce --> Settings --> Checkout screen.
